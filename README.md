# Axios:

axios is a library that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for making HTTP requests in Node.js. In this particular case, it is used to make a GET request to the YouTube Search Results API to retrieve data in JSON format.

While you could use other libraries or built-in Node.js modules such as http, https, or request to make HTTP requests, axios provides a number of advantages, including:

A simple and easy-to-use API with methods for all HTTP request types (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
Automatic handling of JSON data, including parsing and stringifying
Automatic handling of response codes and errors
Support for request and response interceptors to modify requests and responses
Support for canceling requests and timeouts
Browser and Node.js compatibility
Using axios can simplify the process of making HTTP requests in Node.js, and provide a more consistent and reliable experience for handling responses and errors.
